CSC-1310-105 Program 1 README.md

We chose to create a Video Game Library simulation program. This is a menu based program that will allow the user to add games, 
removes games, displays the, saves them, and loads them to a file. We will utilize a class to store the data of each video 
game and a loop to control the menu of the program.
