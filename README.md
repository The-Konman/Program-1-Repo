CSC-1310-105 Program 1 README.md

We chose to create a Movie program. This is a menu based program that will allow the user to add movies, 
remove movies, display them, save them, and load them to a file. We will utilize a Movie class for the data and 
a DvdShelf class to store the data. Our third class will be a sub-data class in Movie called Rating.
